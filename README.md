# My Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration, written in Lua for enhanced performance, maintainability, and flexibility. It uses **Lazy.nvim** (a package manager by *Folke*) to efficiently manage plugins and optimize startup time. The config is organized into clearly labeled sections based on functionality, such as UI, navigation, and code editing, making it easy to customize and extend.

## Notes:

- Some of the code in this configuration is forked from the **Kickstarter Neovim config**, with personal adjustments and customizations to better suit my workflow.

- This configuration is a work in progress and may continue to evolve as I explore new tools and workflows.
